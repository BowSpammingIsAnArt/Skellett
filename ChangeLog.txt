1.9.7:
Removed:
	- Removed RPGPlayerLeveling syntax (Was a bad plugin API from the start)
	- Removed SkellettProxy (Use Skungee now)
	- Removed regenerators
	- Removed the DataTypeWatcher packet (Can't be asked to do research and update it's reflection)
	- Removed ProtocolSupport (Their API has drastically changed)
	- Removed One In The Battle Support
	- Removed MySQL syntax, use SkQuery or that other MySQL addon
	- Removed Feudal support (Plugin was abandoned)
	- Removed Eggwars support
	- Removed Book support (It's in vanilla Skript now)
	- Removed SquidHQ (They moved on to managing a minecraft server list site)
	- Removed fireworks (I added them in vanilla Skript)
	- Removed Async World load effect (FAWE has been abandoned at the moment)
	- Removed Packets
	- Removed Dyed Armour (It's in vanilla Skript now)
	- Removed Crop State (The Spigot API for crops has changed completely)
	- Removed the Spigot checker (Skellett's token for the Spigot API has expired)
Changed:
	- In the latest CorpseReborn, you can't set/get the player instance of the corpse, so now new syntax `name of corpse %corpse%` will just return the name of the corpse.
Fixed:
	- Fixed version checking on events not working.
	- Fixed opening books to players for 1.14.4 servers.
		- Also made the syntax multiple players `open book %itemstack% to %players%`

Skellett should be ready for 1.16, and will break in 1.17 I will see you in another 2 years.
